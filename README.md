# Code to transmit and recieve signal using sx1278 LoRa chips on Raspberry pi picos
This is a basic program that usees [this library](https://github.com/YandievRuslan/sx1278-LoRa-RaspberryPi) To transmit a small packet and use that to start a timer that ticks faster as time goes (basically a makeshift timebomb). There are some more features I want to implement with this, so it's more of a rough sketch than anything
